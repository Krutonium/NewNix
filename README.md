# My New NixOS Config

An evolution of my previous config, this repo represents my current NixOS configuration across my machines. It is a work in progress, and I am still learning NixOS, so there are likely to be some mistakes.

Realistically though, it should be easy enough for anyone to learn from and use as reference.


Each directory, where appropriate, should contain a README.md file with more information about the contents of that directory.
